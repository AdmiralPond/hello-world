This is me dipping my toes in the water of coding. I am attempting to learn html, java, and css at the moment but am very interested in exploring what languages are out there and what they can do and what I can do. Any advice would be welcomed I am starting from scratch and teaching myself so critics and advisors are a must.# hello-world
This is for the tutorial. I'm not sure where this will go.
